Bench Development Configuration
===============================

This is the user configuration for a [Bench](http://mastersign.github.io/bench)
environment to build the Bench system itself and its documentation.

Use this repository as the source for the user configuration,
in case you check out the [Bench repository](https://github.com/mastersign/bench)
and initialize the configuration.

**Warning:** To build the Bench system, there are more prerequisites necessary
then this configuration describes.
To build Bench and its documentation you need at least [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 SDK][.NET_SDK]
with _MSBuild_ or [Microsoft Visual Studio 2015][VS], and the [Sandcastle Help File Builder][SHFB].
